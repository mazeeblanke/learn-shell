# Cheatsheet for Learning Shell

> This is a collection of Shell scripts that are split by [topics](#table-of-contents) and contain 
code examples with explanations, different use cases and links to further readings.

It is a **cheatsheet** because you may get back to these code examples once you want to recap the 
syntax of [standard Shell statements and constructions](#table-of-contents).

## How to Use This Repository

you are free to do the following:

- [Find the topic](#table-of-contents) you want to learn or recap.
- Read comments and/or documentation that is linked in each script. 
- Look at code examples and assertions to see usage examples and expected output.
- Change/Modify code
